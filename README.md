# GitSum

As developers, we routinely search GitHub for libraries, packages, utilities, and patterns we can use to improve our own applications. We have to consider a variety of things about each repo to decide which ones are best to work with: Number and reputation of contributors. Number of commits, over different periods of time. Number of issues. Open pull requests. Number of forks. And the list goes on, making this process a manual, tedious effort each time we do it.

This is where GitSum comes in. It allows users to easilly summarize and compare data for GitHub repositories.
